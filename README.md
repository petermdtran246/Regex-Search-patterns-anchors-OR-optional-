# ✨ Regex Pattern Matching in Python  
### Practical NLP & Text Preprocessing Exercise

This project demonstrates how to use **Python’s `re` module** to search, filter, and manipulate text using **regular expressions**.  
It includes real examples of:

- Anchors (`^`, `$`)
- Character sets (`[aA]`)
- OR patterns (`(need|want)`)
- Optional characters (`?`)
- Text extraction
- Basic NLP-style text cleaning
